Description
***********

cerbero is a multi-platform build system for Open Source projects that builds
and creates native packages for different platforms, architectures and distributions.

Projects are defined using recipes files (.recipe), which provides a description
of the project being built such as name, version, licenses, sources and the way
it's built. It also provide listing of files, which is later used for the packaging.

Packages are defined using packages files (.package), describing the package name,
version, license, maintainer and other fields used to create the packages. A
package wraps a list of recipes, from which the list of files belonging to the
package will be extracted.


********************
Minimum Requirements
********************

cerbero provides bootstrapping facilities for all platforms, but it still needs a
minimum base to bootstrap

Linux
-----
On linux, you will only need a distribution with python >= 2.6 and python's argparse module,
which is already included in python2.7

OSX
---
On OSX you will need to have install the following software:
  * XCode
  * CMake: http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2-Darwin64-universal.dmg

Windows
-------
The initial setup on Windows is a little bit longer, but only a few programs are required.
  * Python2.7: http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/
  * Git: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git
    IMPORTANT: Select the install option "Checkout as-is, Commit as-is"
  * Msys/MinGW: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/
    Install it with all the options enabled

The Direct Show plugins still needs to be built using Microsoft's compiler and their SDK,
due to the dependency on the Direct Show base classes.
You will to install the following software:
  * Microsoft SDK 7.1: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
  * Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852365

cerbero must be run in the MingGW shell, which is accessible from the main menu
The last step is making python and git available from the shell, for which you will need
to create a .profile file.
  $ echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:/c/Python27:/c/Git/bin\"" > ~/.profile

Note that in side the shell, / is mapped to c:\Mingw\msys\1.0\

when available.
